# Using TypeScript with React-Table

Types for React Table are maintained externally by the Typescript community and are located at https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/react-table.

Because React Table is not written in Typescript and the types are not maintained by the core team, there are no guarantees around the types always being up to date or working perfectly. If this is an issue for you, please contribute to the community types and discuss solutions there.

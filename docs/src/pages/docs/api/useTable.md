# `useTable`

- Required

`useTable` is the root hook for React Table. To use it, pass it with an optionsÂ object with at least a `columns` and `data` value, followed by any React Table compatible hooks you want to use.

### Table Options

The following options are supported via the main options object passed to `useTable(options)`

- `columns: Array<Column>`
  - Required
  - Must be **memoized**
  - The core columns configuration object for the entire table.
  - Supports nested `columns` arrays via the column's `columns` key, eg. `[{ Header: 'My Group', columns: [...] }]`
- `data: Array<any>`
  - Required
  - Must be **memoized**
  - The data array that you want to display on the table.
- `initialState: Object`
  - Optional
  - The initial state object for the table.
  - Upon table initialization, this object is **merged over the table's `defaultState` object** (eg. `{...defaultState, ...initialState}`) that React Table and its hooks use to register default state to produce the final initial state object passed to the `React.useState` hook internally.
- `initialState.hiddenColumns: Array<ColumnId: String>`
  - Optional
  - The initial state object for hidden columns
  - If a column's ID is contained in this array, it will be hidden
  - To update `hiddenColumns`, pass a new array into `setHiddenColumns` which is supplied by `useTable`. Changing `hiddenColumns` directly won't cause the table to add the hidden columns back.
- `autoResetHiddenColumns: Boolean`
  - Defaults to `true`
  - When `true`, the `hiddenColumns` state will automatically reset if any of the following conditions are met:
    - `columns` is changed
  - To disable, set to `false`
- `stateReducer: Function(newState, action, prevState) => newState`
  - Optional
  - With every action that is dispatched to the table's internal `React.useReducer` instance, this reducer is called and is allowed to modify the final state object for updating.
  - It is passed the `newState`, `action`, and `prevState` and is expected to either return the `newState` or a modified version of the `newState`
  - May also be used to "control" the state of the table, by overriding certain pieces of state regardless of the action.
- `useControlledState: HookFunction(state) => controlledState`
  - Optional
  - If you need to control part of the table state, this is the place to do it.
  - This function is run on every single render, just like a hook and allows you to alter the final state of the table if necessary.
  - You can use hooks inside of this function, but most of the time, we just suggest using `React.useMemo` to memoize your state overrides.
  - See the FAQ ["How can I manually control the table state?"](../faq#how-can-i-manually-control-the-table-state) for a an example.
- `defaultColumn: Object`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `{}`
  - The default column object for every column passed to React Table.
  - Column-specific properties will override the properties in this object, eg. `{ ...defaultColumn, ...userColumn }`
  - This is particularly useful for adding global column properties. For instance, when using the `useFilters` plugin hook, add a default `Filter` renderer for every column, eg.`{ Filter: MyDefaultFilterComponent }`
- `getSubRows: Function(row, relativeIndex) => Rows[]`
  - Optional
  - Must be **memoized**
  - Defaults to `(row) => row.subRows || []`
  - Use this function to change how React Table detects subrows. You could even use this function to generate sub rows if you want.
  - By default, it will attempt to return the `subRows` property on the row, or an empty array if that is not found.
- `getRowId: Function(row, relativeIndex, ?parent) => string`
  - Use this function to change how React Table detects unique rows and also how it constructs each row's underlying `id` property.
  - Optional
  - Must be **memoized**
  - Defaults to `(row, relativeIndex, parent) => parent ? [parent.id, relativeIndex].join('.') : relativeIndex`

### Column Options

The following options are supported on any column object you can pass to `columns`.

- `accessor: String | Function(originalRow, rowIndex) => any`
  - **Required**
  - This string/function is used to build the data model for your column.
  - The data returned by an accessor should be **primitive** and sortable.
  - If a string is passed, the column's value will be looked up on the original row via that key, eg. If your column's accessor is `firstName` then its value would be read from `row['firstName']`. You can also specify deeply nested values with accessors like `info.hobbies` or even `address[0].street`
  - If a function is passed, the column's value will be looked up on the original row using this accessor function, eg. If your column's accessor is `row => row.firstName`, then its value would be determined by passing the row to this function and using the resulting value.
  - Technically speaking, this field isn't required if you have a unique `id` for a column. This is used for things like expander or row selection columns. **Warning**: Only omit `accessor` if you really know what you're doing.
- `id: String`
  - **Required if `accessor` is a function**
  - This is the unique ID for the column. It is used by reference in things like sorting, grouping, filtering etc.
  - If a **string** accessor is used, it defaults as the column ID, but can be overridden if necessary.
- `columns: Array<Column>`
  - Optional
  - A nested array of columns.
  - If defined, the column will act as a header group. Columns can be recursively nested as much as needed.
- `Header: String | Function | React.Component => JSX`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `() => null`
  - Receives the table instance and column model as props
  - Must either be a **string or return valid JSX**
  - If a function/component is passed, it will be used for formatting the header value, eg. You can use a `Header` function to dynamically format the header using any table or column state.
- `Footer: String | Function | React.Component => JSX`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `() => null`
  - Receives the table instance and column model as props
  - Must either be a **string or return valid JSX**
  - If a function/component is passed, it will be used for formatting the footer value, eg. You can use a `Footer` function to dynamically format the footer using any table or column state.
- `Cell: Function | React.Component => JSX` <a id="column-object-cell"></a>
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `({ value }) => String(value)`
  - Receives the table instance and cell model as props
  - Must return valid JSX
  - This function (or component) is primarily used for formatting the column value, eg. If your column accessor returns a date object, you can use a `Cell` function to format that date to a readable format.
- `width: Int`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `150`
  - Specifies the width for the column (when using non-table-element layouts)
- `minWidth: Int`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `0`
  - Specifies the minimum width for the column (when using non-table-element layouts)
  - Specifically useful when using plugin hooks that allow the user to resize column widths
- `maxWidth: Int`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `0`
  - Specifies the maximum width for the column (when using non-table-element layouts)
  - Specifically useful when using plugin hooks that allow the user to resize column widths

- `columns: Array<Column>`
  - A **nested** array of final column objects, **similar in structure to the original columns configuration option**.
  - See [Column Properties](#column-properties) for more information
- `allColumns: Array<Column>`
  - A **flat** array of all final column objects.
  - See [Column Properties](#column-properties) for more information

  - This function is used to resolve any props needed for your table body wrapper.
  - Custom props may be passed. **NOTE: Custom props will override built-in table body props, so be careful!**
- `prepareRow: Function(Row)`
  - **Required**
  - This function is responsible for lazily preparing a row for rendering. Any row that you intend to render in your table needs to be passed to this function **before every render**.
  - **Why?** Since table data could potentially be very large, it can become very expensive to compute all of the necessary state for every row to be rendered regardless if it actually is rendered or not (for example if you are paginating or virtualizing the rows, you may only have a few rows visible at any given moment). This function allows only the rows you intend to display to be computed and prepped with the correct state.

- `setHiddenColumns: Function(Array<ColumnId: String> | Function(oldHiddenColumns) => Array<ColumnId: String>) => void`
  - This function can be used to set the `hiddenColumns` state for the entire table.
  - If a value is passed, `hiddenColumns` will be set to that value
  - If a function is passed, it will received the previous `hiddenColumns` value and will be expected to return the new value.
- `toggleHideAllColumns: Function(?value: Boolean) => void`
  - This function can be used to toggle or set the visibility for all columns to `true` or `false`
  - If a value is not passed, the visibility for all columns will be toggled back and forth from `true` to `false`
  - If `true` is passed, all columns will be hidden
  - If a `false` is passed, all columns will be visible
- `getToggleHideAllColumnsProps: Function(userProps) => props`
  - This function can be used to retrieve all necessary props to be placed on an `<input type='checkbox'>` component that will control the visibility of all columns
